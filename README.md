## üß© Embedding the Map in WordPress

You can embed the public map using an iframe:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://your-deployed-site.com"
  width="100%"
  height="700"
  style="border:0;"
  allowfullscreen
  loading="lazy">
</iframe>
```

### Optional Category Filter for Specific Pages:

```html
<iframe src="https://your-deployed-site.com?category=Outdoor%20Recreation" ...>
</iframe>
```

This will filter the map to show only listings in that category.

## ü§ù Final Notes

Please ensure the hosting solution supports `Next.js` (e.g., Vercel, Netlify with SSR enabled, or self-hosted). If any content updates are needed in the future, they can be done directly from the admin panel.

If the WordPress developer needs to load the map filtered by category, they can append `?category=Category%20Name` to the iframe source URL.

For assistance, contact the original developer for API route details and advanced usage.
